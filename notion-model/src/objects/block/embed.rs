/// ğŸš§ Differences in embed blocks between the Notion app and the API
///
/// The Notion app uses a 3rd-party service, iFramely, to validate and request
/// metadata for embeds given a URL. This works well in a web app because Notion
/// can kick off an asynchronous request for URL information, which might take
/// seconds or longer to complete, and then update the block with the metadata
/// in the UI after receiving a response from iFramely.
///
/// We chose not to call iFramely when creating embed blocks in the API because
/// the API needs to be able to return faster than the UI, and because the
/// response from iFramely could actually cause us to change the block type.
/// This would result in a slow and potentially confusing experience as the
/// block in the response would not match the block sent in the request.
///
/// The result is that embed blocks created via the API may not look exactly
/// like their counterparts created in the Notion app.
